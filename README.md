grunt-typescript================Compile TypeScript## DocumentationYou'll need to install `grunt-typescript` first:    npm install grunt-typescriptThen modify your `grunt.js` file by adding the following line:    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-typescript');Then add some configuration for the plugin like so:    grunt.initConfig({        ...        typescript: {          base: {            src: ['path/to/typescript/files/**/*.ts'],            dest: 'where/you/want/your/js/files',            options: {              module: 'amd', //or commonjs              target: 'es5', //or es3              base_path: 'path/to/typescript/files',              sourcemap: true,              fullSourceMapPath: true,              declaration: true,			  node_modules: true            }          }        },        ...    });If you want to create a js file that is a concatenation of all the ts file (like -out option from tsc),you should specify the name of the file with the '.js' extension to dest option.    grunt.initConfig({        ...        typescript: {          base: {            src: ['path/to/typescript/files/**/*.ts'],            dest: 'where/you/want/your/js/file.js',            options: {              module: 'amd', //or commonjs            }          }        },        ...    });# Working with modules in node_modules (i.e. npm)The standard way to use npm packages is to provide a definition filethat specifies the package to the typescript and import the module from there.    ///<reference path="path/to/mod.d.ts" />    import mod = module('mod')The typescript compiler will convert the `import` to a nodejs `require`.    var mod = require('mod')This is pretty unwieldy as you need to know the precise path to thenpm installed package and npm can put the package at pretty much anylevel when you are working with multiple levels of dependencies.With the `node_modules` option in the grunt config you can just`import` a npm package without need to know the exact level where thepackage has been installed by npm as long as it is installed locallyand not globally.To `import` an npm module in your typescript source do    import npmModule = module('node_modules/npmModule/foo')Mostly due to a lucky chance this works. Typescript compiler will readthe typescript definition file `node_modules/npmModule/foo.d.ts` if itis present at some point on the way towards the root and the resultingjavascript file will contain a `require` for `npmModule/foo` if needed.
